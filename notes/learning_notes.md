# Learning notes

## Skills practiced

- Nmap scanning
- Metasploit basics (use, set, show options, exploit)
- Resource scripts (.rc) for automation
- Handling sessions (sessions -l, sessions -i)
- Basic Linux enumeration

## Reflections

- What felt easy?
- What was confusing?
- Which commands do you want to memorize?

## Next steps

- Add a new exploit to full_attack.rc.
- Try a Meterpreter payload on a different target.
- Add more automation (logging, scripts).
